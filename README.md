# COVID Antibody

This repository contains the scripts and data necessary to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in the paper "SARS-CoV-2 Humoral Immune Responses in Convalescent Individuals Over 12 Months Reveal Severity-Dependent Antibody Dynamics" to be published in Nature's Communications Medicine.

# Repository structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data/

Contains the primary datasets used in the analyses. These datasets are required for generating all figures and performing statistical tests:
- combined_df_annotated_2023-05-09.csv: Primary dataset used for the analysis of antibody dynamics.
- combined_df_annotated_babson_2025-01-07.csv: Dataset specific to analyses involving Babson antibody testing.
- combined_df_annotated_rbd_spike_2023-05-09.csv: Dataset specific to analyses of anti-spike antibodies.

figure_2/, figure_3/, figure_4/, figure_5/, figure_6/, supplementary_figures/

Each folder corresponds to a figure in the main paper or supplementary materials. The structure of each folder is as follows:
- source/: Contains a Quarto file with R code for the analysis and statistical testing related to the respective figure(s) using the datasets in the data/ folder.
- output/: Contains the outputs generated by running the corresponding Quarto file in the source/ folder. This includes: figures, statistical tables, and other relevant outputs.
